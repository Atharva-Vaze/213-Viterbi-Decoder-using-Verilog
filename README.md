# -2-1-3-Viterbi-Decoder-using-Verilog
Viterbi Decoder for a (2,1,3) Convolutional Code 
Xilinx ISE 14.7 was used to simulate the code. Synthesis was also performed. 
The Following is the Hierarchy of Implementation:
Testbench.v - 
              Viterbi Top Module
              Branch-Metric-Module.v
